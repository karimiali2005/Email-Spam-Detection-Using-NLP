( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines .  to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle .  genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans  the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way .  a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe .  japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly .  japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 .  genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test .  management :  dr . tony milici -

"Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01  the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please  treat with discretion .  executive summary :  ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives .  politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from  an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new  power generation  ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of  out - of - state generators  ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional  plan  ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected  $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper  administration involvement  ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court  ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling  ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout  deal  1 . ferc fallout  the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks  like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to  continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to  allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape  shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the  administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the  administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the  forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps  on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the  construction of new generation .  it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were  generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who  favors price caps actually voted against this plan .  2 . something less than effective price caps  from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws :  ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west .  non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to  california .  ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power  than a ceiling .  ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game  the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2  emergency and does not require any collusion .  ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the  highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require  wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the  cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc .  3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis  the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be  withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the  regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the  regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines  blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse .  4 . growing fiscal risk in california  sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion  on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of  pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the  situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take  further action to control prices for power .  the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about  90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to  finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals .  the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge  loans they are providing to california .  the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness  of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will  have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating  deficits in a matter of months .  5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e  meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the  bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts ,  since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for  gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the  qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw  of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline .  6 delays likely in new qf generation  the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being  continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those  contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated .  7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan  harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an  analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a  utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number  of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a  "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even  if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is  no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be  used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would  be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according  to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private  company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for  the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not  stand a likely constitutional challenge .  8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts  the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term  power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis .  even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been  negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will  challenged , creating an even further delay .",0,

"Subject: cera monthly oil briefing - cera alert - december 20 , 2000  title : cera monthly oil briefing : fundamentals update  e - mail category : cera monthly briefing  cera knowledge area : world oil  in the past two weeks , oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength  that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages  this winter . the exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard  to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil  stock situation is at least stabilizing , even if stocks have not built  substantially , and that , thus far , despite a few weeks of colder - than - normal  temperatures , heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key  us market . that has allayed some of the concerns that were driving  speculative interest into the market . furthermore , the potential for weakness  in the us economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001 .  the change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that  iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide , yet , the iraqi export  cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals . if the cutoff lasts  through december , the effect will be pronounced - it would turn a projected  fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0 . 5 million barrels per day ( mbd ) into a  stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . we expect iraqi production levels to remain erratic  because of its dispute with the un security council over sanctions , and  exports may again cease . at some point such a development would have a price  supportive effect .  cera ' s price outlook for 2001 remains the same as that in the world oil watch  released in late november . assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or  repeated shutdowns of iraqi production , the projected average for first  quarter 2001 is $ 29 per barrel for wti . however , this outlook is based on  opec ' s announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its  production by the start of the second quarter . a failure to restrain output  would result in a downward adjustment to an average of $ 27 wti for the first  quarter of 2001 , with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in  the first . the downward pressure results from the prospect of a  larger - than - usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about  3 . 0 mbd - with a cut in opec output .  iraq in a twilight zone  as anticipated , iraq ceased exporting oil under the un - controlled "" oil for  food "" program as of december 1 in protest over the rejection by the security  council ' s sanctions committee of its proposed december export price schedule . *  iraq ' s pricing was judged by the un overseers , who monitor the export program  and advise the sanctions committee , to be about 60 cents per barrel below  comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that  iraq was seeking from buyers .  although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues , iraq partially  resumed exporting on december 13 . since then , about 1 mbd has been exported  from the mina al - bakr terminal in the persian gulf . prior to the shutdown ,  iraqi exports under un auspices were at a rate of 2 . 21 mbd for november , as  compared with 2 . 08 mbd for the third quarter . exports for november were about  1 . 3 mbd from mina al - bakr and about 0 . 9 mbd from ceyhan in the mediterranean .  exports from ceyhan have not resumed , owing to the surcharge dispute , with  the result that about 1 . 2 mbd of iraqi crude remains off the market .  iraq ' s semi - shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its  dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues . ( in the midst of  this dispute , the un security council approved phase nine of the oil - for - food  program at the last minute on december 5 ; it became effective on december 6  and has been accepted by iraq ) . as of decemberl 9 , iraq ' s revised export price  for ceyhan , proposed for the remainder of december , has again been judged too  low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions  committee . additionally , the overseers have notified lifters of iraqi crude  that any oil payment made directly to iraq rather than to the un escrow  account would be a violation of un sanctions . buyers of iraqi oil from mina  al - bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a  surcharge to iraq .  how long iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear , but it continues  to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at ceyhan in an  apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the un financial controls that are  the heart of the sanctions system . the distinction that iraq has made between  mina al - bakr and ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at mina al - bakr by  loading two cargoes for the india oil company . iraq may have judged this  accommodation to be in its interest , since it recently also signed an oil  exploration contract with india under which payments would be made in oil . as  currently structured , the deal would violate un sanctions , but india is  seeking an exception from the security council on grounds of economic  hardship . the exception seems unlikely to be granted , which may lead iraq to  cease exports from mina al - bakr again .  there are many possible scenarios that iraq could follow , but we expect  uncertainty about iraqi exports to continue as iraq uses its oil exports as  leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the security  council to end all restraints . consequently , the iraq factor will remain an  element in the oil price outlook .  iraq ' s antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the iraq  issue in washington as the incoming bush administration prepares to take  office . secretary of state - designate colin powell has already acknowledged a  need to reassess iraq policy and has said that he would work to "" reenergize ""  sanctions . the iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign  policy - oriented think tank in washington . a consensus seems to be emerging  around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by  retaining un control over iraq ' s oil revenue and strictly enforcing a  prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general  trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international  irritant . there is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to  destabilize or remove the saddam hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that  the prospects for success are remote .  demand trends  record high us natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for  gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so ,  and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas . interruptible gas  customers with resid or distillate fuel back - up have already switched to oil ,  so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the  already high level of distillate demand . so far in december us distillate  demand is running at a record high december level of 3 . 9 mbd . however , only a  small portion of this demand is the result of economically based  fuel - switching from gas to distillate . cera estimates that the additional  demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is  relatively small , on the order of 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 mbd . in cera ' s view it is likely  that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short  notice because in some cases , this theoretically switchable capacity has not  been used in recent years , and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in  uncertain condition .  switching by interruptible gas customers ( such as utilities ) to distillate  began about a month or more ago , although the volumes involved are relatively  small . switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices  started to surge in the summer . a portion of the us secondary and tertiary  distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible  gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage . given the  expectations of a tight gas market , regulators have been explicit about  enforcing back - up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the  current heating season .  other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching .  some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost  of feedstock natural gas is high . natural gas is also used in some enhanced  oil recovery operations , and some of these producers have also opted to sell  gas back to the grid rather than produce oil .  supply trends  non - opec supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0 . 9 mbd over a  year earlier at 46 . 4 mbd . recent events include a shortfall in mexican  production , curtailed in october by about 300 , 000 bd owing to the effects of  hurricane keith . mexico ' s fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be  3 . 64 mbd - about 95 percent of mexican liquids capacity . norway ' s output  increased 200 , 000 bd from october to november as maintenance season ended .  norway ' s production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3 . 53 mbd . *  growing russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a  recent surge in exports , in spite of higher export taxes . russian exports of  domestic oil production ( excluding transit volumes ) reached 2 . 5 mbd in  november , after remaining fairly steady at about 2 . 35 mbd from july though  october . fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2 . 5 mbd , 0 . 3 mbd  greater than in the fourth quarter 1999 .  cera estimates iraqi oil production averaged 2 . 91 mbd in november - down 0 . 1  mbd from the october level . the cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced  iraqi output for the first 12 days of december to roughly 0 . 8 mbd . iraq  resumed exports of about 1 mbd on december 13 , which raised production to  1 . 80 mbd . assuming no change in iraq ' s current production stance , iraqi  production would average 1 . 41 mbd for december . on a quarterly basis , the  decline in iraq output would lead to estimated opec output in the fourth  quarter of 29 . 0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0 . 5  mbd into a stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . these production estimates include 0 . 15 mbd  of crude oil exports to syria that began on november 20 without un  authorization and are continuing .  oil stocks  us crude oil inventories ( doe data ) have climbed intermittently from an  annual low of 280 million barrels in september and reached 292 million  barrels in mid - december ( see figure 1 ) . since prices weakened in late  november , crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in september  and the ranges seen in october to levels from 289 - 292 million barrels .  primary inventories of us heating oil remain well below year - earlier levels ;  at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels , or 24 percent less , than  those of a year ago , but there are indications of builds in secondary and  tertiary inventories . we estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up  5 - 10 million barrels since august and are actually higher than they were at  the end of last year .  in europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with  those of the united states . in november stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels  to 426 million barrels . at this level they are below the highs of 1999 but  well above the low levels of early 1996 ( see figure 2 ) . japanese crude oil  inventories at end - october were 107 . 6 million barrels , which is above the  record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent  years ( see figure 3 ) .  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 -

"" these are very large operations and to some extent they can bear  some risks , "" says pawel kaminski , energy - sector operations officer at  the world bank in warsaw . "" but eventually they have to generate some  return . ""  enron pioneered wholesale gas and electricity trading in the u . s . it  entered europe in 1989 , setting up in london as the u . k . ' s energy sector  liberalized . it entered the nordic market in 1996 , and today is the nord  pool ' s largest - volume trader .  enron says it takes about two years to find a site and obtain permits  for a power plant , and a further 29 months for construction .  just four years after entering the u . k . , enron finished its  1 , 875 - megawatt teesside plant . teesside ' s capacity and cost , at gbp 795  million ( 1 . 32 billion euros ) , are many times larger than nowa sarzyna ' s .  yet teesside was completed in only two - thirds the time . the company  declines to compare development times in various countries .  "" i wouldn ' t necessarily put poland into the same category as russia , ""  says philip davies , regulatory and government - affairs manager at enron  europe in london . "" but obviously , given poland ' s ( planned economy ) past ,  it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory process  and get to the starting point . ""  at nowa sarzyna , it took enron nearly twice the usual time to reach  the starting point , even though mr . astramowicz already knew the site ,  and the polish power industry ' s rules .  the nowa sarzyna plant was mr . astramowicz ' s brainchild , and he  burned out the engine in his first bmw as he traveled between warsaw and  the town to craft the deal . a freelance energy - sector entrepreneur  before joining enron , mr . astramowicz sold his interest in nowa sarzyna  to enron in 1998 .  enron has spent $ 132 million to build nowa sarzyna , a 116 - megawatt ,  gas - fired combined heat - and - power plant . quiet , clean and efficient , the  plant stands in stark contrast to most of poland ' s belching , coal - fired  behemoths . when it starts up this month , it will sell its electricity to  the polish power grid , the country ' s high - voltage network , under a  20 - year power - purchase agreement , or ppa , that enron won in 1997 . steam  output goes to organika , the chemical company next door , and helps heat  the town of nowa sarzyna .  the nowa sarzyna plant is more than 80 % financed by commercial - bank  loans for which the only collateral is the plant ' s concluded contracts .  "" they were betting on their good name , "" says michael davies , a  partner with allen & overy , the warsaw law firm that advised enron  poland ' s lenders . "" they are pushing envelopes all the time . ""  that is especially true in a market with 30 % overcapacity , where an  energy law didn ' t even exist until 1997 .  says peter bisztyga , emerging europe utilities analyst at solomon  smith barney in london : "" because enron signed a ppa , they are ok . . .  ( but ) i ' m really not sure building nowa sarzyna was such a good idea . ""  mr . bisztyga says enron could have generated a faster return by  renovating an existing power plant . but , he acknowledges , nowa sarzyna  "" allowed enron to get into the polish market early and stamp their name  on it . ""  in 1994 , polish power plants weren ' t for sale . energy asset  privatization , discussed for years , began in earnest only this year . by  2002 , the polish government proposes to sell off stakes in dozens of  power plants , 33 distribution companies and the polish power grid , a  12 , 000 - kilometer national transmission network of high - voltage lines .  the assets have a total book value of 33 billion zlotys ( 8 . 4 billion  euros ) , but murky regulations have driven prices down .  "" the regulations don ' t promote competition and so you don ' t really  know the price of electricity , "" says bengt wegemo , president of  vattenfall poland . earlier this year , vattenfall paid $ 235 million for  55 % in warsaw - based elektrocieplownie warszawskie , promising $ 340  million in investment in the heat - and - power plant over the next 10  years .  investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing .  ultimately , 170 licensed energy traders and 200 large power users will  trade on the bourse , setting the wholesale price of electricity . the  polish bourse will be modeled on its nordic counterpart . enron , the nord  pool ' s largest trader , hopes to post polish trading profits by 2001 .  but first , say market experts , poland ' s 1997 energy law must be  amended to ease functioning of the bourse , and free up access to  poland ' s distribution network .  further , the government says it must solve the competition problem  posed by the polish power grid ' s power - purchase agreements , which  account for 70 % of energy sales in poland . some state - owned plants used  the agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing . when  prices are freed , these plants might go bankrupt if forced to compete  with plants that didn ' t spend money to modernize .  the government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the  modernized plants for their extra costs . though nowa sarzyna is a  private plant , the price enron must charge for its power is about twice  what outmoded plants charge .  "" we are hoping that continuous , efficient operation of the plant will  generate us a ( bigger ) profit , "" mr . astramowicz says .  another problem is cross - border power trading , where contradictory  legislation essentially gives a monopoly to the polish power grid , also  known as pse . enron and others protest that pse shouldn ' t compete with  electricity - market participants who contract with it for transmission  service .  pse intends to stay in the trading business , says marek zerka , pse ' s  vice president . in late march , pse and local company kulczyk holding  signed an agreement with preussenelektra ag of germany to export  electricity and coal to eu countries via germany .  "" this is great news , "" mr . astramowicz says . "" if this joint venture  gets access to pse ' s cross - border transmission capacity . . . i would  expect pse to confirm open access to all market participants . ""  enron and others are pushing hard for that access . "" as soon as the  market becomes open , free and non - discriminatory , we will come out at a  decent profit , "" mr . astramowicz says .  folder name : enron in europe  relevance score on scale of 100 : 78  to review or revise your folder , visit http : / / www . djinteractive . com or  contact dow jones customer service by e - mail at custom . news @ bis . dowjones . com  or by phone at 800 - 369 - 7466 .

"Subject: re : eprm article  chris ,  this is very well written and will serve the reader well . a few comments .  1 . when i think about the taxonomy of the var models , i typically use the  classification based on 3 categories :  a . variance / covariance method  b . historical simulation  c . monte carlo simulation .  delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear  instrument .  2 . i would define monte carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation  of behavior of  all the market prices / rates , etc . , and revaluation of the entire portfolio .  the revaluation may be based on an approximation ( using taylor ' s expansion )  that may  involve delta , delta / gamma , delta / gamma / omega or may be exact ( based on the  same  model that produces the mark - to - market portfolio valuations ) .  the main benefit of using the mc simulation in the energy markets is the  ability to capture  the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way . i would  emphasize that  there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the v / c model ( i shall send you  the references  from home ) .  3 . i would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets  that are evolving  quickly ( new instruments for which we have no comparable prices ,  behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de - mature ) .  4 . for bigger portfolios , virtually all methods require some level of  aggregation into  atomic , elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem .  this process may be a source of a big error .  5 . the computational burden of mc can be reduced through clever preprocessing  of a portfolio that introduces no error . many swaps with the same underlying  can be aggregated into one positions ( they are portfolios of forwards and  they are linear  instruments ) .  please , feel free to use any comment ( or none ) .  vince  "" chris strickland "" on 08 / 28 / 2000 02 : 58 : 56 pm  please respond to "" chris strickland ""  to :  cc :  subject : eprm article  dear vince ,  ?  d you think you might be able to look at this in the next day or so ? robin  is after something by the end of this week .  ?  best regards .  ?  chris .  ?  - eprm _ 01 _ var . doc",0,

"Subject: re : pre - submitted question on espeak  erin ,  a book by martha amram and nalin kulatilaka is an excellent  non - technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most  important  references to more advanced books and papers .  the book has an endorsement by jeff skilling on the cover page .  the research group offered several one - day seminars on real options  and applications to the energy industry . we still have a few binders with  the presentation materials available if you are interested .  we plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall .  the first part of the seminar ( about 4 hours in the morning ) covers general  concept of real options  and their applicability to the energy business .  the second , more technical afternoon session , covers stochastic processes used  to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case  studies ( valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas - fired  power plants ) .  the real options approach has been developed specifically to address the  problem of making  investment decisions under uncertainty . nobody in this field claims that this  is a  perfect tool , but it represents a significant progress compared to other  techniques developed  earlier .  discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through  analysis of several , in most cases , arbitrary scenarios ( most likely ,  optimistic ,  pessimistic ) . these scenarios don ' t identify explicitly the risk drivers  and don ' t specify the future proactive management decisions .  the real , option approach is very powerful because it allows to ( 1 ) capture  uncertainty in an explicit way and ( 2 ) to design investment projects that  allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to  downside risk .  this approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and  future  operational decisions . forward - looking investment decisions create options  that are exercised  in the future through active management of a project .  the real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to  come  up with the representation of future possible states of the world . the real  challenge is  to use these tools in a sensible way . i have seen in my career ( almost 30  years  of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems ) many quants  armed with  powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers . the  challenge is not  to run mechanically thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions  but to translate in a creative way the insights of people who understand  specific businesses  into parsimonious quantitative models . it is especially critical to  stress - test the assumptions  of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends  critically on any set of assumptions .  if this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying  assumptions .  i remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the  dynamics of oil prices ,  but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very  optimistic upward trend .  one would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question  what economics 101  teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand .  enron north america corp .  from : erin rice @ enron 06 / 27 / 2000 03 : 52 pm  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : pre - submitted question on espeak  good news ! there is already a question waiting for your july 12 espeak  session . i have pasted it below , although you don ' t have to respond until  the actual event . don ' t forget to send a bulleted list of discussion topics  if you would still like us to advertise the event on the elevator screens .  thanks .  - er  submitted by breineck  i was doing some reading about the application of real options in the  evaluation of non - financial assets . would you recommend any texts or articles  for a  more in - depth study of this area ? is quantification of risk or uncertainty  the major challenge in using this concept ? can statistical tools be used with  this to do  a sort of sensitivity analysis ?",0,
